description: 'Simulation of water balance of soils and plants within forest stands. Medfate also allows simulating plant growth, mortality and recruitment processes of a set of cohorts competing for light and water within a forest stand. Finally, it also allows relating the amount of plant biomass and the water status of plant tissues to fuel characteristics and, hence, fire hazard.'
